A tree is a nonlinear hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges.
Tree are needed because all other data structures are linear. Operation on linear data structure take more time. So to reduce the time complexity the 
trees are used.
Node - A node is an entity that contains a key or value and pointers to its child nodes.
       last node of each path is called external node
       a node with a child node is called internal node
Edge - It is the link between any two nodes.
Root - the first node(topmost).
Degree of a node - The degree of a node is the total number of branches of that node.

Type of trees- 
  Binary Tree
  Binary Search Tree
  AVL Tree
  B-Tree
