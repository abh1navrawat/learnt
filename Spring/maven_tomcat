Apache Maven and Apache Tomcat are both widely used tools in the Java ecosystem, but they serve very different purposes:

Apache Maven

Type: Build Automation Tool
Purpose: Maven is primarily used for managing project dependencies, building projects, and automating the deployment process. It uses a Project Object Model (POM) to define project structure and dependencies.
Features:
Dependency management: Automatically downloads and manages libraries and dependencies.
Build lifecycle management: Provides a standardized way to build and package Java applications.
Plugin system: Allows for extensibility through plugins for tasks like testing, packaging, and deployment.
Project management: Helps maintain project configuration and documentation.

Apache Tomcat

Type: Web Server and Servlet Container
Purpose: Tomcat is designed to serve Java web applications. It implements the Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages (JSP) specifications and provides a runtime environment for Java applications.
Features:
Serves Java applications: Handles HTTP requests and responses, running Java servlets and JSPs.
Lightweight and flexible: Suitable for running small to medium-sized applications.
Support for various protocols: Primarily HTTP, but can also handle other protocols.
Configuration: Offers various configuration options for performance tuning and security.
Summary

Maven is used for building and managing Java projects, while Tomcat is a server that runs those Java applications. They often work together in a Java development workflow, where Maven builds the application and Tomcat serves it.
