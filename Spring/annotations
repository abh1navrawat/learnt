@Component -  annotation that allows Spring to detect our custom beans automatically.(convert a class, so that it can be used for objects).getBean method is used to call the object


@bean - Annotation to to indicate that a method instantiates, configures and initializes a new object to be managed by the Spring IoC container.


@Autowired - It allows Spring to resolve and inject collaborating beans into our bean. Enable dependency injection in java classes.  It allows Spring to automatically inject dependencies into the class,
             eliminating the need for manual configuration. Will search for that object in that spring container, It searches for the type not the name 

@Qualifier - seaching the object through name, same working as autowired.
